Hi, need a web/mobile application? Then Let's talk.
Having a well design and pixel-perfect makes the difference.  So, I'm a big fan of front-end coding. Back end layer are often invisible to the end user, yet no advanced application can work without them. So I love back end as well. 
I have years of experience working with all major web development platforms, and the modern frameworks and cloud infra.
 I don't care too much what language I use â€” yet I do prefer the aws product suite, javascript and it's frameworks.
I love both creating innovative digital products and working with my team, regardless of which affection spurred the other.
Let's work.
