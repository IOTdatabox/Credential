# Angular

Greetings,

I have read your job description and found that I can be the perfect match with all the required skills.
My skillsets are as following:
- Angular(15: 2+ years) 
I have used Angular framework to create several large project from ground up and update some in progress.
Then I got very interested in Angular15 since it makes heavy use of Typescript as a typing. Actually I think it enables Angular to overcome its non-typing issue, one of the critical drawbacks of JavaScript itself.
I am very familiar with Angular ui bootstrap, Angular material and some material & bootstrap dashboard themes(Metronics, Fuze).
- React(2+ yrs)
I've been much experienced in React, Redux and Flux to boot.
Actually I found React makes the project going successfully and running with great performance. I've worked on React bootstrap themes(Rubix, BeyondAdmin).
- Related Techs
Some of them are Task runners(grunt, webpack, gulp), JS preprocessor(Coffeescript), JS typing(Typescript), devOps(Babel), CSS preprocessor(Sass, Less, Bourbon), JavaScript utility libraries(lodash, underscore, linqjs) and Module loaders(ES6, ES7, commonjs, AMD, requirejs)
- Testing Scripts
I have best practise in JavaScript testing(Phantomjs, Casperjs) and unit test framework(Jasmine, Mocha, Karma).

With my skills and experiences, I can develop your project perfectly on time.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,

# Django

Greetings,

I'm a technical Python developer. I have 8+ years experience in web and application development.
I have a strong background in cloud-based solutions, API development, distributed computing, and prototyping utilizing Python and the Django Framework. I'm really good in HTML, CSS, Python, Django/PHP, React/Next.js, Redis, Memcache, Postgresql & ElasticSearch.

Having worked with many AWS services including deployment of several web apps to EC2/Lambda, I can manage the AWS instance professionally with scalability and low latency in mind.

The good thing here is that I can work on both Django and frontend solutions (React, Angular, Vue, etc) - although it's not ideal to have someone work on both stacks in one project, it's always very useful to know the other side of the role so that I can make my stuff more integrable and well documented.
I have a proactive attitude with sense of ownership and strong work ethics and having worked at various agencies in my career, acquired excellent organizational and time management skills.

Please check the following websites as a reference to my recent work :

Technologies: Backend: Django 1.8, Postgresql, ElasticSearch, Redis, Amazon S3, RQ, Pillow, Django Rest Framwork. Frontend: jQuery, Knockout.js, lodash, Typeahead, Masonry

Thanks for your read, ready to discuss more about the project during the interview.

The good thing here is that I can work on both .NET and frontend solutions (React, Angular, Vue, etc) - although it's not ideal to have someone work on both stacks in one project, it's always very useful to know the other side of the role so that I can make my stuff more integrable and well documented.
