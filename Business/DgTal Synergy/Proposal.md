# ABOUT US

We are a global distributed team consisting of developers and brokers. Brokers provide their personal information to create Upwork accounts, while developers leverage these accounts to generate income. The proceeds from Upwork projects are then shared between developers and brokers. Our developers hail from regions such as Asia, Africa, and South America, whereas our brokers are based in the US, South America, Canada, and LATAM.

Most of our brokers do not have a technical background and face various challenges in their lives. Our mission is centered around mutual assistanceâ€”helping our brokers while receiving their aid in return. We cultivate a culture of encouragement and support within the team.

# HOW DO WE WORK

Our working process is adapted to comply with Upwork's stringent security policies. Developers cannot directly use brokers' accounts; instead, they access Upwork remotely through Anydesk/Teamviewer. Developers purchase computers for their brokers to facilitate this arrangement. A developer may collaborate with multiple brokers depending on their skill level, marking the beginning of an individual business relationship.

The steps involved are:

1. Brokers receive a computer from their developer.
2. Together, they set up a new email, create an Upwork account, and establish a dedicated payment method for Upwork transactions.
3. When bidding starts and a job is secured, the broker assists with any required ID/visual verification by Upwork.
4. As developers secure more work, the accounts grow, increasing monthly income and mutual benefits.
5. Both developers and brokers maintain transparency by sharing all details of the Upwork and payment method credentials, fostering trust and a long-term relationship.

Brokers provide the necessary support for job acquisition, earning money without the need to code. Developers obtain the projects and ensure payment is processed through Upwork and the payment methods provided by brokers to maintain honesty and account safety.

# RESPONSIBILITIES

### Brokers
- Maintain the remote computer online 24/7 with stable internet and electricity.
- Manage Upwork, payment, and Google accounts.
- Occasionally handle video/voice calls with Upwork clients for further verification purposes.

### Developers
- Secure jobs on Upwork.
- Receive payment via Upwork.
- Withdraw earnings to the broker's designated payment methods.

If an Upwork account is suspended, developers must continue contracts outside of Upwork and still funnel payments through the broker's payment methods.

# BENEFIT

Compensation for brokers comes in two primary forms, with an additional bonus option available:

### 1) Fixed Basis
Developers pay brokers a fixed monthly sum ranging from $150 to $200, paid on the 25th of each month.

### 2) Percent Basis
Income is split between developers and brokers, with brokers receiving 10-15% of the earnings.

The variability in compensation is a result of differing job acquisition probabilities based on the account's location and the initial difficulty of securing projects. After the first three months, brokers are guaranteed a minimum of $150 per month.

## Bonus Option
Brokers who manage client calls that lead to successful job acquisitions or refer new brokers to the team are eligible for bonuses. Bonus amounts are negotiable and proportional to the brokers' efforts.
