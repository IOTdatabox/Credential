Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in this position, as advertised. With over 6 years of experience as a Web3 & Blockchain developer, I have consistently demonstrated my expertise in crafting innovative and robust web-based and blockchain solutions.
I have successfully led the launch of a famous largest NFT launchpad, Launchmynft.io and the powerful multi-chain Dex platform, Gempad.app using Soldity/Truffle/Hardhat, Rust/Anchor/Solana. I also have extensive experience working with diverse technology stacks, including but not limited to Angular, React, Python, Rust, Golang, AWS.
One of my notable achievements includes spearheading the development of an enterprise application, gempad.app, which just implemented Presale, Staking, OTC sale, Lock, Bridge functionalities and provide project owners and administrators with them.
My proficiency extends to smart contract development, having created custom contracts for wallet app functionalities, integrated DEX aggregator smart contracts, and contributed to Rust-based APIs and PostgreSQL databases. I have actively worked on Solana programs, NFT smart contracts, and played a crucial role in building the company's new programs.
I honed my skills in smart contract technologies, and blockchain technologies, and I leverage them contribute to EIP 1559 protocol upgrade and conducted open-source contributions from Metaplex libraries. 
My skills encompass a wide range of technologies, including Python/Rust based microservice architecture, Nest.js, React.js, Solidity, Anchor, Golang, Go-Ethereum, Truffle, Hardhat, AWS serverless stack, and web3.js.
Most valuable products and live domains below:
1) Gempad.app (Next.js, Solidity/Hardhat, Rust/Anchor) - A revolutionary multichain decentralized launchpad designed to provide a secure and transparent environment for project owners to initiate funding rounds for their tokens, while offering contributors a safe and seamless platform to participate in these sales.
- Wrote smart contracts for EVM based networks and solana programs
- Built UI components from the UI/UX design given and writing smart contract codes.
- Released versions: testnet.gempad.app, legacy.gempad.app, gempad.app, 

I am going to explain my experience related to presale / locks / stacking etc. I started this project from 4 years ago. That was just legacy version (legacy.gempad.app) Now the current version V2 (gempad.app) has wonderful functionalities of presale, locks, stacking, OTC sale (I suggested this idea to my client, maybe other launchpads will never have this function), bridge. Especially, presale field will catch your eyes. I set the values softcap and hardcap, and gempoints. If someone has enough gempoints, he/she can be registered as whiltelist, so that the wallets enlisted in whiltelist can take part in presale stage. This platform provides project owners and token holders with wonderful fundraising services. Most of tokens from EVM based networks have successfully launched now in this platform. Currently, I am on the way to launch Solana version(solsale.app) in the near future.

2) Launchmynft.io (Golang, Rust, CandyMachine, Go-Solana) - A fully automated NFT collection generator that requires no technical knowledge. It offers a simple three-step process: importing assets, setting metadata and rarity, and launching the collection. Users can customize their mint page and promote their NFTs online.

- Implemented CompressedNFT and programmableNFT by Go-Solana SDKs and Golang
- Though we have wonderful compressed token management libraries from Metaplex, there is no go-solana sdks for cNFT/pNFT. I implemented the same functionalitis of CandyMachine and cNFT including merkle tree account creation and getting merkle proof using read data api.

I am going to explain about CandyMachine through this experience. You know CM helps us mint NFTs easily. I recently helped them mint compressedNFT (cNFT) using CandyMachine v6, and recently, I tried to implement cNFT again by Golang and go-solana sdks. It worked fine. Of course, Metaplex provides us good examples and libraries for most of CM minting and cNFT, but go-solana sdks don't have such this functionality yet. I was very hard to write pure golang codes like instruction, transaction, metadata args, etc. But you know, the result was that I delivered the project on time. This experience was one of the most challenging what I've encountered so far.

I am excited about the prospect of bringing my expertise and passion for innovation to your team. I am confident that my skills, combined with my proven track record of successful project management, make me a valuable candidate for this role. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your organization's needs.
Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to contribute to your team's success.

Sincerely,
Erivelton Costa
