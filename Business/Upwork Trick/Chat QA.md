Regarding your suggestion for a video chat, I prefer to communicate via text chat for several reasons. It makes it easier for us to keep track of everything and gives us both more flexibility. Plus, I'm totally committed to being super responsive!

Let's stick to text chat within Upwork for our discussions.

Excited to get started on this collaboration with you!

https://adepspro-partenariat.be â€“ the platform dedicated to supporting high-level athletes of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation.
-	Required skills: Next.js, TailwindCSS, Sanity.io
-	My role: I worked as a frontend developer, mainly focusing on building pages and retrieving content from Sanity CMS. I utilized Tailwind CSS for styling. I was part of the Adeps group, a significant player in the sports industry.

6) Shopify
I built fast, flexible themes at scale using Liquid, Shopify's theme templating language, along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON.

As a theme developer, I can optimize the organization, features, and style of merchants themes for specific market segments or use cases.

I can also offer different theme customization options, which enable merchants to create their desired customer experience without editing code.
In other words, Merchants can customize their theme from the Shopify admin by using the Shopify theme editor.

As an app developer, you can build an app that extends the functionality of a merchant's theme.
