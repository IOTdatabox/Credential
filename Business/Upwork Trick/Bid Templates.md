This job captured my entire soul, but what made me hesitate to bid on it was whether I would be lucky enough to have you read my cover letter and proposal and be interested in me. I spent 1 hour to apply for this position and win this job. Though I have great experience with web frontend/backend stuff, that would not be the only factor for winning. I hope you place great emphasis on this kind of effort and interpersonal skills as well. That would be my bonus. Team collaboration, strong interpersonal skills, avid/quick learner are common testimonials from my customers. Would love to connect and to find out if I would be a real fit.
=================================
Are you still open to hiring for this role? This job captured my entire soul, but what made me hesitate to bid on it was whether I would be lucky enough to have you read my cover letter and proposal and be interested in me. I have spent much time to think about how to land you and win this job but no specific solution found yet. Regarding your required skills, there should be nobody to have problems in development among the candidates. Though we have encounter the problem, google , chatgpt, stackoverflow will help us. When it comes to remote working in distributed team environment, for both client and developer, communication, team spirit, interpersonal skill, personality are also important. What do you think? Although I have 9 years of experience in your filed, Node/Nest/Express, React/Angular, AWS, etc, my upwork profile is not strong to show all my potential stuff. Strong interpersonal skills, good communication, work ethic of "nothing is impossible", and genuine commitment to long term contribution are what I always bring to any client in any position. Do you think that is what sets me apart from others?
Let me make it clear that I am not saying this to cover up my weaknesses. Because of the limitation of cover letter, 5000 letters, I can't provide all information of my successful launched products where I contributed to, even only overviews. But let me try to put some of my proud achievements below.

==================================
I don't like bragging, but I've done this quite a bit because I don't think my Upwork profile is strong enough to get the job. I would rather take the technical test and if I pass, we can work together. I hope that.

=====================================
I'm not talented enough, but I work hard & what I know is "Hard work always beats talent, when talent doesn't work Hard!!‚Äù

### Golang / Rust ### (Erivelton)
I helped ExitLag (Brazil) ensure better and faster connection routes to game servers, eliminating connection issues with a single button press and bring an end to Lag, Ping, Packet Loss and Jitter issues by patching users through the optimal route in real time. The mainly requried skills were golang, and rust as microservices. We used websocket and ClickHouseDB and PostgreSQL DB as well.
And I also designed configurable REST APIs on demand using Go. I worked on numerous go frameworks like gin, revel, beego.
Good understanding of Design Patterns, Multithreading and Go containers, well versed in using Channels and goroutines would benefit this position.
