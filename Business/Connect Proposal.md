## Call Support Verbal
my team and I have built the fantastic relationship hub between developers, job seekers, those in need, and clients. We're essentially the bridge connecting them all. Each member of our team plays a unique role.
We've got ID providers on board who are looking to make some cash, but they're struggling with work-life balance, you know? Think drivers, designers, street vendors, and the like. We take their info and craft profiles to help them land IT jobs. We transform them into skilled software developers, even though they might not be the smoothest when it comes to software engineering.
Here's the kicker: they struggle with technical interviews and coding assessments, which are basically mandatory in the hiring process. That's where we need help. Our current developers aren't exactly fluent in English, so we're looking for some native English speakers to bridge the gap between the ID providers (who are mainly from the US, Canada, and the UK) and our developers.
If these third-party developers land a gig, they'll work in the company at their hourly rates. The rest of the income goes to support my team and the ID providers. Makes sense so far?
Now, if your developers are swamped with full-time gigs, we could potentially outsource their job offers to my developers.
That's the gist of what I wanted to discuss. If you're intrigued by this business idea, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

## Call Support Proposal
I am looking for a good English speaker who can do audio call management in EST timezone.
500$ per month salary
Will require Good speaking English and basic tech skill.
Full availability and 3 - 4 hours of call handling every day.
Please DM me if interested.

## Trading Bot

I BUILT A MONSTER!!!
I've conducted in-depth research on the foreign exchange market, quantitative and time-series analysis, and micro and macroeconomics for several years,  improved on the traditional Martingale method and developed the MT 5 bot, , which generates a total profit of over 10% per month on 5 currency pairs. - XAU/USD - 4%, EUR/USD - 2.5%, EUR/JPY - 1.5%, AUD/CAD - 1.5%, AUD/SGD - 1.5%

Please take a look at the videos below.
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Po7WLWBUN5gKPqZuXp_zDfeBaPmmUB62?usp=sharing

I am so confident in my bot that I won't release it on the MT5 marketplace.
Instead, I look forward to cooperation with a co-founder.
I‚Äôm setting a GUARANTEE that it will increase your profit by 8% for every MONTH or it‚Äôs free forever.
Anyone come to mind that should give it a try?
