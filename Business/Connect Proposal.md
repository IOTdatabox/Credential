## Trading Bot

I BUILT A MONSTER!!!
I've conducted in-depth research on the foreign exchange market, quantitative and time-series analysis, and micro and macroeconomics for several years,  improved on the traditional Martingale method and developed the MT 5 bot, , which generates a total profit of over 10% per month on 5 currency pairs. - XAU/USD - 4%, EUR/USD - 2.5%, EUR/JPY - 1.5%, AUD/CAD - 1.5%, AUD/SGD - 1.5%

Please take a look at the videos below.
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Po7WLWBUN5gKPqZuXp_zDfeBaPmmUB62?usp=sharing

I am so confident in my bot that I won't release it on the MT5 marketplace.
Instead, I look forward to cooperation with a co-founder.
I’m setting a GUARANTEE that it will increase your profit by 8% for every MONTH or it’s free forever.
Anyone come to mind that should give it a try?

## Waison 3
Hi, My name is Waison, a senior full-stack engineer.
I have been in IT for 10 years, working for companies, and it's the same story every, single, day.
There is barely any value doing this at my point in career, and life.

I would much rather build Saas startups, whether for side cashflow, or bigger startup ventures to go public. That is still the plan long-term.

I am looking for a former engineer or digital (marketing, promotion, customer relationship) professional with a passion and entrepreneurial spirit to partner with me and start a software agency.
If you want, keep doing what you are doing now. Even just supporting from the side would be a great help.

If interested, please email me.

This will be my primary focus for the rest of my life and therefore I am full of authenticity.

Thanks and Regards,
Waison

## Waison 4
Hi , I hope you are doing well.
I am Waison, a all-rounded software engineer with 10+ years of experience.
I’m currently retiring from full-time employment and exploring AI, product-market fit, and other areas, driven by a passion for creating new value in the tech industry.

I’m looking for a fellow enthusiast to partner with me, share expertise, and help build a software agency together.

Plus, I am happy to join that kind of agency making own micro saas products and tacking the customer's projects.

If you are interested or have any advise, I'd love to connect!

Please email me.
waison.lee1029 at gmail dot com

Thanks and Regards,
Waison

## Waison 5

As a full-stack engineer with a strong focus on UI/UX, I’m transitioning from full-time employment to freelancing, driven by a deep passion for creating impactful solutions for customers and the digital world. Over the years, I've developed a broad skill set, ranging from designing seamless user experiences to building robust backend architectures.

I’ve been thinking about starting a software agency and am looking for a like-minded partner who can complement my strengths. I believe that combining our technical knowledge, business sense, and creativity, we could create something truly valuable and impactful. The aim would be to work together to deliver meaningful digital solutions for clients while scaling the business over time.

I’m confident we could complement each other’s skills, making this a successful venture.

The great thing is that I’m not necessarily looking for someone to be involved full-time right away.
Even with part-time contributions, I believe we can start building a initial momentum and scale from there.

If this sounds interesting to you, I’d love to explore the idea further and discuss how we could make this partnership work.
Kindly email me

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,  
Waison
