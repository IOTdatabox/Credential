I'm Waison, a professional UI engineer and a full-stack JavaScript developer. Throughout my career, I've built over 100 websites from scratch and revamped more than 50. My work is known for well-architected layouts, typography, mobile responsiveness, and SEO optimization. I rely on my expertise in React, Next.js, Node.js, Shopify, Squarespace, HTML, Tailwind CSS, AWS, GitHub, and more to deliver high-quality solutions.

One of my notable achievements was developing a comprehensive solution to help businesses rapidly transform by identifying unique attributes, setting clear goals, mitigating risks, and leveraging automation. The project aimed to enhance online presence, engage audiences, and optimize marketing strategies for growth. It involved multiple components like business identification, web optimization, and social interaction, making the UI/UX and backend architecture as complex as Notion.

I collaborated with designers and product managers from the wireframe stage, contributing technical insights that helped shape the final design. I used Next.js for componentization, managed state with Redux, and styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn. On the backend, I developed RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints using Node.js, adhering to validation and error-handling standards. I also integrated ChatGPT API to generate content, identify target audiences, and suggest products, ensuring a smooth user experience.

As the project manager, I promoted a collaborative team culture, with no conflicts during the six-month beta development. The product launched on time and reached over 10K users within one month, thanks to the efforts of both the engineering and marketing teams.

Though I have deep experience in various technologies, I continue to learn and explore new areas like AI and product-market fit. Iâ€™m transitioning from full-time employment to freelancing, driven by my passion for creating value in the tech industry.

I'm eager to take on new challenges and deliver high-value solutions to my clients. Thank you for considering me, and I look forward to the opportunity to work together.
