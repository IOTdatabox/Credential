I am Waison Lee, a full-stack software engineer with a global mindset and years of experience working in a bunch of different fields like eCommerce, Fintech, data management and building SaaS applications for both web and mobile.

Recently, I started a new chapter as a co-founder of Akselsoft, and right now, I'm all in on making sure our operations run smoothly. We're just starting out, but we've got big plans and the drive to make something meaningful happen.

Our world today is really crying out for digital solutions. Whether you look at healthcare, insurance, or finance, finding software you can really trust is still a big deal.

And take social networks—none of them have quite nailed how to celebrate everyone's differences without letting the harmful stuff get through.

There are so many ways software can help make life better—making work more efficient, improving well-being, or helping people connect with each other. We know we can't fix every problem, but we're committed to throwing all our creativity and skills into delivering innovative solutions that match what our clients are dreaming of and are facing on.
