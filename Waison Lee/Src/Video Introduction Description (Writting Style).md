As a globally-minded full-stack software engineer, I bring over a decade of experience to the table with a background in diverse industries such as eCommerce, Fintech, data management, and SaaS web/mobile applications development.

I have recently embarked on a new journey as the co-founder of Akselsoft, dedicating my focus to its operations. Although we are at the outset, we are confident in our potential to create something truly significant.

Indeed, the modern world is in dire need of innovative digital solutions. In sectors like insurance, medicine, and finance, the issues of software security and trust continue to persist.

Moreover, despite good intentions, no social network has yet achieved the perfect equilibrium—promoting diversity while effectively filtering out only those voices that genuinely obstruct it.

The possibilities for software applications—to boost productivity, enhance well-being, or foster human interaction—are limitless. While we acknowledge that we cannot address every single challenge, our aim is to consistently deliver innovation that aligns with our clients' visions to the fullest extent of our capabilities.
