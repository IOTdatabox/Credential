**Role:** [Data Analyst, Full-Stack Developer] Full Time Employee at Esplanade Ventures
**Project Title:** Empowering Physicians with Best-in-Class AI Radiology Solutions
**Project Duration:** [January 2023 - August 2024]

**Project Description:**
Led the development of a state-of-the-art AI solution aimed at transforming radiology practices. This project focused on automating radiology processes to save time, reduce burnout among radiologists, and enhance the quality of patient care. The solution integrated advanced AI techniques to streamline reporting, automate impression generation, and manage follow-ups efficiently.

### **Key Responsibilities and Achievements**

1. **Reporting Automation:**
   - **AI-Driven Report Generation:** Designed and implemented an AI-based system to automate the generation of radiology reports. Utilized PyTorch to develop deep learning models capable of analyzing medical images and generating accurate impressions, reducing the manual effort required for report writing.
   - **Customizable Reporting Templates:** Developed customizable report templates, enabling radiologists to tailor reports to specific institutional standards and practices, enhancing the flexibility and usability of the generated reports.

2. **Automation of Radiology Impressions:**
   - **Machine Learning Model Development:** Leveraged PyTorch for training and deploying machine learning models to analyze radiological images. The models identified key features, anomalies, and provided preliminary diagnostic suggestions, streamlining the diagnostic process for radiologists.
   - **Integration with PACS:** Integrated the AI solution with existing Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) to automate the retrieval and submission of medical images, ensuring seamless incorporation into radiology workflows.

3. **Follow-Up Management:**
   - **Automated Alerts and Reminders:** Implemented a follow-up management system that automatically generated alerts and reminders based on findings from radiology reports. This feature helped ensure that critical findings were acted upon promptly, reducing the risk of overlooked or delayed follow-up actions.
   - **Comprehensive Tracking System:** Developed a tracking and documentation system to maintain records of follow-up actions and outcomes. This provided a clear audit trail and facilitated better patient management, improving the efficiency of follow-up processes.

### **Technical Skills and Tools Used**

1. **PyTorch:**
   - Utilized PyTorch to develop and train deep learning models for image analysis. Leveraged its dynamic computation graph for flexible experimentation and optimization of model performance.

2. **AWS SageMaker:**
   - Employed AWS SageMaker for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. Utilized SageMaker's managed environment for efficient model development, including hyperparameter tuning and scalable deployment.

3. **Power BI:**
   - Used Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations for monitoring system performance and user activity. Enabled real-time insights into key metrics and performance indicators, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

4. **TypeScript:**
   - Applied TypeScript for frontend development, building a robust and scalable user interface. TypeScriptâ€™s static typing system contributed to code quality and maintainability, facilitating a seamless user experience.

### **Impact and Outcomes**

- **Increased Efficiency:** Reduced the time required for radiology report generation and follow-up management through automation, allowing radiologists to focus more on patient care.
- **Reduced Burnout:** Alleviated the cognitive and physical load on radiologists by automating repetitive tasks, contributing to lower burnout rates and higher job satisfaction.
- **Enhanced Patient Care:** Improved the accuracy and timeliness of radiological diagnoses and follow-ups, leading to better patient outcomes and more effective management of patient care.
